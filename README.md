## Description
Facei is a mobile application designed primarily for fun. With Praktapp, you can swap your nose with various fruits and change your background by selecting different options. Additionally, if you choose your favorite style, you can take a screenshot by expanding the bottom app bar. I also wrote a story in Polish about my journey of doing this app [Medium Article](https://medium.com/@kmalak4822/o-kodzie-kt%C3%B3ry-pozornie-nie-sprawia%C5%82-wi%C4%99kszych-problem%C3%B3w-292d48935bd1)

This app was developed within one month as part of a school apprenticeship project. During the development process, I had a tutor who provided occasional tips and guidance.

## Used To Do App
- Body Detection Package
- Screenshots
- CustomPaint
